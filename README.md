This particular repository has one purpose.

Test the difference between windows and Linux.

Ensure the code does not break when I switch back and forth from one OS to the next.

Ensure that my .gitignore ignores everything I want it to.

I have a very large existing code base I would like to add to git, but I have to test all the scenarios first.
